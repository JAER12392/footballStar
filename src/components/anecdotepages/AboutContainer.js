        <p id="introduction-seattle">Hi. Iâ€™m Jesus Alberto Esquivel Ramos,
          I'm 26 years old. Born in Toppenish, Washington and raised in Fife, Washington.
          FootballStar's inspiration comes from the countless hours I spent dreaming
          about becoming a soccer player. From a young age I always had grand vision of one
          day realizing my dreams. This is three part series that will allow the user to dive into my
          progressions as a person and computer programmer. This is beginning of my vision that I have
          spentless hours on visualizing. Shout to my mother, without your support this would not be possible.
